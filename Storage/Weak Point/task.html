<h2>Weak Point</h2>
<p>
 While traveling, the spaceship endures quite a lot of stress. As a result, an important part of the maintenance is
    to check the outer hull. Stephan uses a digital durabilitimeter for this task. The device scans a portion of the
    spaceships hull and gives a durability map that is divided by small square fragments with measurements. Sometimes
    Stephan does not have much time and he can patch only couple points, so we need an algorithm to find the weak
    points.
</p>
<p>
 The durability map is represented as a matrix with digits. Each number is the durability measurement for the cell.
    To find the weakest point we should find the weakest row and column. The weakest point is placed in the intersection
    of these rows and columns. Row (column) durability is a sum of cell durability in that row (column). You should
    find coordinates of the weakest point (row and column). The first row (column) is 0th row (column). If a section has
    several equal weak points, then choose the closest point to the top edge and if there are multiple points closest to
    the top edge, then choose from those points the point that is closest to the left edge.

  How it is used:
 </strong>
 Matrices (2D array) are an often used data structure and it will be helpful to sharpen your skills with them.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Precondition:
 </strong>
 <br/>
 0 &lt; len(
 <strong>
  matrix
 </strong>
 ) â‰¤ 10
 <br/>
 all(len(row) == len(
 <strong>
  matrix
 </strong>
 ) for row in
 <strong>
  matrix
 </strong>
 )
 <br/>
 all(all(0 &lt; x &lt; 10 for x in row) for row in
 <strong>
  matrix
 </strong>
 )
