  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round
        eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.
        "Poor little thing!" said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried
        hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the
        time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it
        would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of
        stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped
        into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,
        and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice
        dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run
        over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy
        made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in
        its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very
        like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
        moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle
        again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the
        stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long
        way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat
        down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its
        mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

  A stick I found that weighed two pound:
  <br/>
  I sawed it up one day
  <br/>
  In pieces eight of equal weight!
  <br/>
  How much did each piece weigh?
  <br/>
  (Everybody says “a quarter of a pound”, which is wrong.)

 The robots want to saw the stick in several pieces. The length of the stick is
 <strong>
  N
 </strong>
 inches.
    We should help our robots saw the stick. All of the parts should have integer lengths (1, 2, 3 .. inches, but not
    1.2).
    As we love the numerical series and especially the Triangular numbers
    (
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number">
  read more about Triangular numbers on Wikipedia
 </a>
 ),
    you should saw the stick so that the lengths form the consecutive fragment of the Triangular numbers series
    with the maximum quantity (fragment's length).
    The parts should have different lengths (no repeating).
    For example:
 <strong>
  64
 </strong>
 should divided at
 <strong>
  15, 21, 28
 </strong>
 ,
    because
 <strong>
  28, 36
 </strong>
 is shorter and
 <strong>
  1, 3, 15, 45
 </strong>
 is not a consecutive fragment.
</p>
<p>
 You are given a length of the stick (N).
    You should return the list of lengths (integers) for the parts in ascending order.
    If it's not possible and the problem does not have a solution, then you should return an empty list.

  Input:
 </strong>
 A length of the stick as an integer.

<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 A fragment of the Triangular numbers as a list of integers (sorted in ascending order) or an empty list.

  How it is used:
 </strong>
 In this task you will learn about triangular numbers.
    A triangular number or triangle number counts the objects that form an equilateral triangle.
    This is an interesting sequence which has various applications.
 <br/>
 Here’s a real world application:
    In a competitive tournament format that uses a round-robin group stages,
    the number of matches that need to be played between n teams is equal to the triangular number T
 <sub>
  n−1
 </sub>
 .
    For example, a group stage with 4 teams requires 6 matches, and a group stage with 8 teams requires 28 matches.
