  The Dark Labyrinth
 </a>
 to have been your training before taking on this challenge, young
    grasshopper. Once again, you find yourself in a labyrinth. It's dark and the batteries in your
    flashlight have died. Due to your preparedness, you have in your possession an ultrasound
    scanner which can define the depth of passages in four directions. If you think that this will
    solve all your problems, then we have some news for you. You can not remember anything and use
    the scanner memory card. But it has an extremely limited capacity and can only remember 100 bits
    between runs.
</p>
<p>
 The labyrinth is 12x12 cells and surrounded by walls on all sides. Keep in mind, you are
    surrounded by darkness, so be careful to not run into a wall. This is a "multicall" mission and
    as such, your function will be called until you have solved the maze or run out of moves. For
    each iteration you receive a dictionary with information about the distances of walls in four
    directions: "N" - North, "S" - South, "W" - West and "E" - East. For example: if a neighbour
    cell is wall, then the distance is 0. You will see the exit only when you enter the exit cell.
</p>
<p>
 The second function argument is a "memory" number. For each iteration we restart the
    environment, thus you cannot store data in global variables. Memory numbers are 100 bit, so they
    can range from 0 (including) to 2
 <sup>
  100
 </sup>
 (excluding).
</p>
<p>
 For each iteration your function should return one or several actions as a string with
    directions and a memory number. Actions are described as directions: "N" - North, "S" - South,
    "W" - West and "E" - East. For example: the string "NWS" describes a sequence of three moves.
    The memory number is an integer 0 ≤ n &lt; 2**100.
    This number will be given in your function in
    the next iteration. You run too fast so you shouldn’t make a move that would have you walk into
    a wall. To make things interesting, you are limited to 300 moves (not iterations).
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 Two arguments.
    Scanner results as a dictionary and the memory number as an integer.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 A tuple or a list with the action string and the memory number.

  How it is used:
 </strong>
 This concept is an exploration mechanism with restrictions.
    Build upon the concepts from the Dark Labyrinth to solve this challenge.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Precondition:
 </strong>
 The labyrinth are surrounded by walls.
 <br/>
 len(maze) == 12
 <br/>
 all(len(row) == len(maze) for row in visible)
