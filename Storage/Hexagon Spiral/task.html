<h2>Hexagon Spiral</h2>
<div class="story">

<p>
 Bees are very well organized insects. Let's suppose that bees have numerical ordering system for
    their honeycomb. If each cell in the honeycomb is
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon">
  hexagon
 </a>
 and the bees want to build an accurate
    honeycomb then one method the could use to build it is to build in a spiraling pattern. This
    would mean that the numerical order is also in a spiral. That way each cell has own number and
    we have navigation system on the honeycomb. For this mission, we will need to account for that
    information while we define the distance between specific cells.
</p>
<p>
 The map of the honeycomb consists of a collection of hexagonal elements. The first element in
    the center is marked as 1 and in a continuing clockwise spiral, the rest of the elements are
    marked in ascending order ad infinitum. On this map, you can "move" through the adjoining edges
    of the hexagonal elements to place yourself in a neighboring cell.

</p>
<p>
 For example: the distance between elements 1 and 9 is two moves and the distance between 8 and
    18 is two move.
    Between 17 and 13 - 4 moves.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 Pair of numbers that represent 2 elements as integers.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 The distance between the 2 elements as an integer.

 <textarea data-code="python">hex_spiral(2, 9) == 1
        hex_spiral(9, 2) == 1
        hex_spiral(6, 19) == 2
        hex_spiral(5, 11) == 3</textarea>

  How it is used:
 </strong>
 Often times, turn based strategy games or role playing games will use a hex grid based map for
    unit placement allowing for six possible movement directions. This mission will help you to
    write a simple program which can tell a unit the distance between specific cells. Add a few
    restrictions for minimum and maximum distance and you could program not only movement range, but
    also range of attack, area of effect or even range of influence.
