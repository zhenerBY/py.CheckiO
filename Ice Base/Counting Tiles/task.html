 Stephan needs some help building a circular landing zone using the ice square tiles for their new Ice Base.
    Before he converts the area to a construction place, Stephan needs to figure out how many square tiles he will need.
</p>
<p>
 Each square tile has size of 1x1 meters. 
    You need to calculate how many whole and partial tiles are needed for a circle with a radius of N meters. 
    The center of the circle will be at the intersection of four tiles. For example: a circle with a radius of 2 metres
    requires 4 whole tiles and 12 partial tiles.

   <strong>
    Input:
   </strong>
   The radius of a circle as a float
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Output:
   </strong>
   The quantities whole and partial tiles as a list with two integers -- [solid, partial].

   <pre class="brush:python">
checkio(2) == [4, 12]
checkio(3) == [16, 20]
checkio(2.1) == [4, 20]
checkio(2.5) == [12, 20]

    How it is used:
   </strong>
   This task is a simple geometry problem; but you can use it for architecture and topography.
    As we see in the description, you can calculate the amount of materials needed for a project.

  <p>
   <strong>
    Precondition:
   </strong>
   <br/>
   0 &lt; radius â‰¤ 4
