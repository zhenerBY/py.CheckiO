<h2>Domino Chain</h2>
<p>
 You have a Domino box. Domino tiles contain two numbers from 0 (empty) to 6. Tiles are unordered and 1-6 is the same as 6-1. The double-six set contains 28 unique tiles - all combinations of number pairs.
</p>
<p>
 Several tiles fell out of the box. You should try to line up a chain from these tiles, compiling them to each other's suitable sides (sides with the same numbers). Thus, you can get a continuous chain of tiles. In some cases, such a chain will not be the only one.
</p>
<p>
 For example, you've ended up these tiles:
 <br/>
 <strong>
  1-5, 2-5, 3-5, 4-5, 3-4
 </strong>
 <br/>
 So, with them you can build two complete chains:
 <br/>
 <strong>
  1-5, 5-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-2
 </strong>
 <br/>
 <strong>
  1-5, 5-4, 4-3, 3-5, 5-2
 </strong>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Your goal in this mission
 </strong>
 is to count how many complete chains you can make using all of the given dominoes.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Note.
 </strong>
 Chains must be unique. An inverted chain is not considered as unique: "1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5" and "5-4, 4-3, 3-2, 2-1" are the same chain.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 String with the description of the domino tiles. Like this one: "5-4, 4-3, 3-2, 2-1".
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 Integer. The maximum number of complete chains that you can build using all of the given tiles.

   Examples:
  </strong>
 </p>
 
 <pre class="brush: python">
domino_chain("0-2, 0-5, 1-5, 1-3, 5-5") == 1
domino_chain("1-5, 2-5, 3-5, 4-5, 3-4") == 2
domino_chain("0-5, 1-5, 2-5, 3-5, 4-5, 3-4") == 0
</pre>

 <strong>
  How it is used:
 </strong>
 This is a combinatorial problem. You can solve it by modeling a real game of dominoes. Or refreshing your knowledge of graph theory. Many things in life resemble the process of forming a domino chain: for example, flights between several cities.
