<h2>The Vampires</h2>

<div class="story for_info_only">
 The flocks of crows circled over the battlefield. Many brave warriors have fallen in this battle, many have continued to fight.
 <br/>
 "If this goes on, we’ll simply kill each other, and there will be no winners - we’ll all lose." - reflected Sir Ronald, watching a bleak picture in front of him.
 <br/>
 "I have to make an important decision. I know what it’ll cost, but now that’s the only thing that can save us all..."
 <br/>
 A long time ago, when he was often in search of trouble and adventure, he went to hunt a witch who had  a huge bounty on her head. The bloody creature was able to save her life by persuading the knight to take a gift from her - a vial of vampire blood. This blood poured into the dying man’s mouth could bring him back to life in vampire form.
 <br/>
 Is it really the day when he has to use it?..
 <br/>
 It seemed to be the only way to win this battle.
 <br/>
 Sir Ronald began to lean over the barely living bodies of his knights, who were lying beside him. To each of them he said:
 <br/>
 - "Drink. You’ll be given a new life..."

<p>
 So we have 3 types of units: the Warrior, Knight and Defender. Let's make the battles even more epic and add another type - the Vampire!
 <br/>
 Vampire should be the subclass of the Warrior class and have the additional
 <strong>
  vampirism
 </strong>
 parameter, which helps him to heal himself. When the Vampire hits the other unit, he restores his health by +50% of the dealt damage (enemy defense makes the dealt damage value lower).
 <br/>
 The basic parameters of the Vampire:
 <br/>
 health = 40
 <br/>
 attack = 4
 <br/>
 vampirism = 50%
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 You should store vampirism attribute as an integer (50 for 50%). It will be needed to make this solution evolutes to fit one of the next challenges of this saga.
